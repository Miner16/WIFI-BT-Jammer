# WHAT DOES IT DO?

**IT CREATES NOISE SIGNAL TO JAM BLUETOOTH AND WIFI USING NRF24L01 AND ESP32 IN RANGE 2.4GHZ DEVICES , EFFECTS MAY VARY DEPENDS ON DEVICE BLUETOOTH VERSIONS **


`NOT TESTED ON 2.4GHZ DRONE I DON'T HAVE ONE BUT IT CAN JAM ONE..... MAYBE?`

## REQUIRED DEVICES:
1. `1 or 2 NRF24`
- ![nrf24l01](https://github.com/smoochiee/Ble-jammer/assets/30816448/c370e76d-d518-409a-ba87-cb087183958c)

2. `1pc ESP32` OR `ARDUINO`

 ## PINS TO ATTACH NRF24L01 TO ESP32

### FOR DUAL NRF24
+ ` HSPI= SCK = 14, MISO = 12, MOSI = 13, CS = 15 , CE = 16`
+ ` VSPI= SCK = 18, MISO =19, MOSI = 23 ,CS =21 ,CE = 22`

### FOR SINGLE NRF24
 - `VSPI= SCK = 18, MISO =19, MOSI = 23 ,CS =21 ,CE = 22`

## DEMO


+ **TESTED 10 METERS ON BLUETOOTH 5.0 AND WORKS GREAT**
+ **TESTED 10 METERS ON NEWER BLUETOOTH 5.3 WORKING DEPENDING ON THE GAP OF BLUETOOTH DEVICE AND PHONE**
+ + **IF YOU WANT BETTER PERFORMANCE YOU CAN ADD 2.4GHZ RF AMPLIFIER**

## COMPILING USING IDE

* DOWNLOAD LIBRARIES YOU NEED AND INSTALL [RF24 LIBRARY](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24) AND [EZBUTTON LIBRARY](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-button-library)
* DOWNLOAD CODE [INO FILE](https://github.com/smoochiee/Ble-jammer/tree/main/INO)

---


## SOME NOTES

* NRF24 CAN DO 125 CHANNELS YOU CAN EDIT IT IN THE CODE
- BLUETOOTH CLASSIC 80 CHANNELS
+ BLE USES 40 CHANNELS
* WIFI USES 1-14 CHANNELS
* DRONE 2.4GHZ 1-125 SO YOU NEED TO EDIT CODE TO HOPE 125 CHANNELS
```
